					<h1 class="text-primary">About Us</h1>
					<p>
						We hold fast to the Bible as the word of God and the unique standard of our teaching.
					</p>
					<h5>We Love the Lord Jesus</h5>
					<p>
						He is our Savior and the source of our joy from day to day.
					</p>
					<h5>We Love the Church</h5>
					<p>
						The Church is Christ's satisfaction and the focus of all His building work today.
					</p>
					<h5>We Love the Lord's Testimony</h5>
					<p>
						The Bible indicates that all Christians in a city are part of the Church in that city. We honor and desire to live according to this fact. This is why we simply gather as "the church in Cleveland".

					<h3 class="text-secondary">Songs & Hymns</h3>
					<p>Hymns and spiritual songs are a great way for believers to enjoy and experience Christ. It’s a very healthy tool for spiritual growth and advancement. It’s a great way of opening our hearts to him, and loving him more. We treasure songs rich in truth and centered on the building the church.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-md-4">
					<h3 class="text-secondary">Bible Messages</h3>
					<p>We give short talks/sermons from the Bible with the view of spiritually enriching and strengthening the believers. As God’s people on the earth, we must be grounded and full of the reality of who Christ is. The Bible is the best means for this, so our messages focus on different topics and books in the Bible.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12 col-md-4">
					<h3 class="text-secondary">Prayer and Testimony</h3>
					<p>Our gathering style provides the opportunity where anyone can stand up and talk about the work Christ is doing in their lives. It also gives the chance to pray after songs and messages shared in the Bible. Paul states in 1 Corinthians 14 each one should bring something to the church meetings, whether a song, revelation for the upbuilding of the church.</p>

						Living a <br/>

					<p class="font-weight-light h5">
						The Christian life is one of togetherness!
					</p>
					<p>
						Who said church was only for Sundays, or is only attended through special meetings? In the Bible, Christians came together "every day" and, coming together in homes, "ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people." (Acts 2:46-47). What we see here is a lack of distinction between "everyday life" and "church"; for these early Christians, church was a lifestyle. Our desire is to live this out here in the city of Cleveland in what we call "the church life". We encourage this kind of living every day through small group Bible studies, home dinners, one-on-one shepherding and teaching, singing Christian songs together, and much, much more!

						Real <br/>
						Companionship
					</h1>
					<p>
						We highly promote building relationships with one another because of the eternal value spiritual companionship has. One means we provide is through our Oasis Coffee House, where we provide various espresso and tea based lattes, with plenty of space to chat, pray and enjoy the Lord over a warm beverage.
					</p>

					<p>
						Join the fun throughout the week and during the holidays as we try to find meaningful ways to spend time together. From weekend trips to explore the beauty of creation, such as at Niagra Falls, to building a "gingerbread tabernacle" based on the Tabernacle of God described in the book of Exodus, we have a broad arsenal for having fun.
